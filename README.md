# guessing_game
A guessing game written in Rust
<br>
Created following the [official Rust Programming Language Book's Programming a Guessing Game section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html).
<br>
Hereâ€™s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.
